# Weather Dashboard

Weather Dashboard is a web application that presents users with real-time weather data and forecasts for cities around the globe. It harnesses the power of [WeatherApi.com](https://weatherapi.com) to fetch current conditions and future weather predictions. This application was built with the intent of exploring Webflow Devlink features and frontend weather data visualization.

## Features

* Search functionality for cities worldwide
* Current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
* A forecast for the upcoming days
* Interactive charts with Chart.js

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Chart.js, Webflow Devlink
* **API**: [WeatherApi.com](https://weatherapi.com)
